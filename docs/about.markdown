Iâ€™m a Hackney based BBC software developer qualified accountant.  Years ago I founded Black Accountants Society in UK.
I previously attended Makers Academy in Shoreditch and Manchester University.

I also campaign for diversity especially neurodiversity.

codingForJustice is an attempt to make change by coding an app to empower the public rather than just talking and campaining on issues.
