Iâ€™m based in Hackney, London.  I was previously the founder of the UK Black Accountants Society.  I work for the BBC as a software developer.
I am also a qualified accountant. I converted to software development via Makers Academy in Shoreditch, Hackney, London.

I am autistic and also campaign for neurodiversity.

As a coder, I want to take direct action for equal human rights using code.

I feel people need to stand up and take direct action.
Black, white, male or female, rich or poor we all have equal human rights.
