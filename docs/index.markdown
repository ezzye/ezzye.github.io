On 17th May at 10 pm on Channel 4, there is a TV programme, [“The Truth About Stop and Search”](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-truth-about-police-stop-search).

I witnessed this outside of my home:

If the powerless owned the BBC, the media would make a difference, but they don’t.

I am a coder, so I want to take direct action to gain equal human rights using code.

I want to form an organisation that would help to make a difference by coding an app.
This would be a way for like-minded junior and senior software engineers and data analysts to make a difference.
A way of taking direct action in the fight for equal justice for all whatever their community or heritage.

The goal is to form an organisation, codingForJustice, open to all, Black or white, male or female, neurotypical or Neurodiverse, straight or gay and whatever your pro-noun.
With the aim is to harness volunteer coders and coding-beginners to write and deploy applications that make a difference.

The first project is to write an app that allows the victims of discrimination to record incidents, make complaints, report to media outlets and get help and support of charities.

If you want to help or find out more information please join or contact me.
