Are you interested in making a difference?

Do you want to meet up and socialise and work with like-minded people?

This is open to all, Black or white, male or female, Neuro-typical or Neuro-diverse, straight or gay and whatever your pro-noun.

The goal is to write an app that uses the social media front-end of sites like Twitter to take direct action to reduce the abuse of police power.
To write an app that allows the victims of discrimination to record incidents, make complaints, report to media outlets and get help and support of charities.

On 17th May at 10 pm on Channel 4, there is a TV programme, “The Truth About Stop and Search”.

I am a coder, so I want to take direct action to gain equal human rights using code.

In 2019/20, Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic people were 4.1 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and for Black people, the figure is 8.9.
And yet, most forces still can’t adequately explain why there is disproportionality in how the powers are used.

So “if disparity cannot be explained, it must be changed”.

For police officers, the exercise of powers such as stop and search, force, and traffic stops is routine.

For the person being stopped, the experience can be embarrassing, intrusive and frightening.

Stop and search is an alternative to arrest and so requires a similar level of suspicion.

It is not random.

Social media and TV programmes raise awareness of issues but do not change institutions.
If the have-nots owned the BBC, the media would make a difference, but they don’t.

I propose a software app that would help to make a difference by taking direct action.
